### Developer Information
Our Services are developed and maintained by `@42gami` ("Owner"), a dedicated developer committed to providing robust and efficient Discord Apps for enhancing Discord server functionalities; alongside other support staff who share and uphold ethical practices relating to our Services. 

## Data Collection
### Types of Data Collected
Our Services collect specific data to ensure its proper functionality and to enhance user experience. The types of data collected include:
- Server IDs: Unique identifiers for the servers where our Bot is active.
- Server Owner IDs: Unique identifiers for the owners of the servers where our Bot is active.
- Discord End User IDs: Unique identifiers for Discord users interacting with our Bot.
- Partial Discord Message Content: Content of messages that directly interact with our Bot, such as commands.
- Full Discord Message Content: Full content of messages that may include server moderation, custom reactions, or forms; even when the message is not related to a direct interaction with our Bot.
- Other Identifiers: Contact details, such as usernames, provided during direct interactions.
- We <u>do not</u> access or collect any combination of Discord End User Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") such as real names, emails, contact numbers or stored payment methods with Discord.

### Purpose of Data Collection
The primary purpose of collecting Server IDs, Server Owner IDs, and other identifiers is to enable our Services to function effectively within the Discord servers. This data allows the bot to:

- Authenticate and authorize its activities within the server.
- Ensure smooth interaction and integration with server-specific settings.
- Facilitate administrative functions, such as managing announcements, events, live-stream management.
- Provide specific features, such as server moderation, moderation logging, custom reactions, and forms.

### Storage of Data
All collected data is securely stored in an encrypted SQL database. The database is designed to handle data efficiently and ensure its availability for our Services's operations.

### Duration of Data Storage
The collected data is retained for as long as our Services remains active in the server. If our Bot is removed from a server, the associated data is also deleted to ensure privacy and compliance with data retention policies.

## Data Usage
### Data Sharing
Our Services do not share any collected data or information with third parties outside of our essential self-managed assets. The data is solely used for the internal functionality of our Services and is not disclosed to any other external entities.

### Data Security
To ensure the highest level of data security, the collected data is stored in an encrypted database on an encrypted server. These measures protect the data from unauthorized access, breaches, and other security threats. Regular security audits and updates are conducted to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the data.

Some specific measures include:

- User Identification and Discord End User Data Processing: Wherever possible, the only identification key related to you that is stored on our system is your “Discord ID”. Your “Discord ID” is a number provided by the Discord API and linked to your Discord End User Data.
- Encryption at Rest: Data stored by our Services is encrypted at rest (when saved in our database, or any data storage media we may be using) using best-in-class algorithms (e.g. AES-256-GCM) and following the most diffuse security guidelines.

## User Consent
### Consent Mechanism
By joining a server that uses our Services and/or interacting with one of our listed Bots, users implicitly consent to the data collection practices outlined in this privacy policy. This consent is necessary for our Bot to function effectively and provide its Services within the server.

### Opt-Out Options
How Can You Opt-Out Of Providing Your Data?<br>
In Short: Our Services may offer the ability to self opt-out of providing your data. When this option is not available, you may contact us to have your situation examined.

Under certain circumstances, you may decide to opt-out of providing your data to us or, in other words, request us to have your personal data tied to your Discord ID deleted from our Services. Depending on the personal information we collect, store, and process, and the specific Service we are offering to you, you may be able to self opt-out of providing some, or all, data.

In relation to the data that we collect, store, and process, you may have the following options regarding the ability to opt-out, or have your data deleted:

- Discord ID
  - Opting out of providing your Discord ID may not be possible in all circumstances. Your Discord ID is, in a general way, not a specific PII unless it’s matched with other personal information that is collected, stored, and processed by Discord. You may refer to the [Discord Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) and [Discord’s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) to know how to opt-out of providing your Discord ID.

- Partial Discord Message Content
  - In regard to the content of messages that let you directly interact with our Bot, such as when using commands, you may self opt-out of all occasions where you provided us with any custom input by disabling, or properly reconfiguring, such features that were configured using custom inputs.

- Full Discord Message Content
  - In regard to the content of messages that you send using the Discord App, even when the message is not related to a direct interaction with our Bot, you may (or may not) have the ability to self opt-out of providing your data depending on the technical implementation of such features that access your full message content. You may refer to the technical documentation of our Services for more information about whether this ability is provided.

- Other Discord End User Data
  - In regard to other types of data we may obtain through the Discord API, you may refer to the [Discord Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) and [Discord’s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) to know how to opt-out of providing such data.

In all cases where self opt-out is not an option, you may contact us in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/RF3CuTkVXH) detailing your inquiry. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

## Legal and Compliance
### Legal Basis
The legal basis for our Services's data collection and processing is the legitimate interest in providing a functional and efficient Bot service to Discord servers. Additionally, user consent is obtained implicitly when users join a server using our Services and/or interacts with our Bot.

### Compliance with Laws
Our Services are committed to complying with relevant data protection laws and regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These regulations ensure that data collection, processing, and storage practices are transparent, lawful, and respectful of user privacy.

### Your Privacy Rights
By choosing GDPR as our privacy framework, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information.

Multiple privacy frameworks may be applied when storing and processing your data. We chose to align with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), extending those rights to you independently of where you are. 

- In "GDPR terminology", as referred to in Article 4, we often refer to the following concepts:
  - Data Subject: Any identifiable natural person whose personal data may be accessed, stored, and processed (in other words, you).
  - Data Controller: Determines the purposes for which and the means by which personal data is processed.
  - Data Processor: Processes personal data only on behalf of the controller.

We are a Data Controller of the information you provide to us, and a Data Processor of the Discord End User Data we are provided by the Discord API. 

According to the GDPR, in certain circumstances (Chapter 3), you may have the following data protection rights:

- The right to access, update or to delete the information we have on you.
- The right of rectification.
- The right to object.
- The right of restriction.
- The right to data portability.
- The right to withdraw consent.

In circumstances where these rights may apply, you may request the application of such rights. To make such a request, you may contact us detailing your inquiry. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

## Childrens Privacy
Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children").
We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personal information to us please contact us as soon as feasibly possible in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/RF3CuTkVXH).

## Payments & Monetization
### Premium Subscriptions Through Our Website
We may provide paid premium subscriptions and/or services within our Services. In that case, we use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors such as PayPal & Stripe).
We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information and the data they collect or already have on you is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.

### Premium Subscriptions Through Discord App Monetization
In the event that Discord extends the scope of its [Monetizing Your Discord App](https://discord.com/developers/docs/monetization/overview) documentation beyond the current jurisdictions of the United States, European Union, or United Kingdom, as specified in said documentation in effect on the date at the top of this our Privacy Policy, to include the country of residence of the Owner, the following actions will be taken:

- Premium subscriptions through Discord Monetization will be implemented as soon as feasibly possible.
- Subscription services through our website for Discord Apps will be discontinued indefinitely as soon as feasibly possible.
- Monetization of our Discord Apps will be conducted in accordance with the [Discord Monetization Policy](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10575066024983-Monetization-Policy) and the [Discord Monetization Terms](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5330075836311-Monetization-Terms).

These will be pertinent to our Bots and Apps used on Discord. Any data divulged or already stored by Discord regarding your payment methods for these subscriptions is not available to us.
